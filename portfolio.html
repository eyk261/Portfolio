    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As a recent graduate in information system technology, I got an opportunity to upskill my 
        technology knowledge with the Generation Junior Web Developer program where I excelled in improving my 
        knowledge about working with coding languages and repositories, assisting with unit testing, and database skills. 
        I thrive on working in fast-paced environments, love to challenge myself, and I am excited to apply my newly polished skills 
        in a Junior Web Developer role.</p>
